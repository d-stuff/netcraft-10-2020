The show was generally run of the mill, but boasted an unusual feature: to keep the show in the spirit of the game, before each commercial break a narrator would ask what the viewer would do to solve the problem facing Dirk the Daring. After the commercial break, the outcomes of the various choices were shown before Dirk acts on the correct idea (with the occasional exception) to save the day. In contrast to the original game, the previously nameless Dragon was known given the name Singe, and Princess Daphne now wore a long pink dress.</p>",
